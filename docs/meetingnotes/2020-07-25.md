### Discussion topic

1. Are there any additional fields needed to support erc20 in the current schema?
- Platform token does not need address, but in the case of erc20, address may be required
- Can erc20 and Platform tokens be handled with the same interface?

2. How about creating the unique and deterministic id of the supporting coin?
- For example, when sending a coin, in order to indicate what coin it is, we need to know all the symbols, network, and platform, so additional parameters are entered too much
- How about designing the id value that is decidedly determined from the network, symbol, and platform?

3. How to support multisig?
- In the current structure, different wallet creation methods cannot be applied for each platform.

4. It is ambiguous that balance is missing from coin in the current schema.

### Topics for further research

1. How to define ERC20 and ETH with the same interface?
2. Defining the most abstracted interface of eth and btc
3. To which component will the tx build role be delegated?
4. Which external api related to utxo will be used(btc)
5. How to derive each platform key from the master key

### Additional Resources

1. Example of BTC address generation and transaction occurrence
2. Example of Integrated wallet api schema proposal(pr: #15)
